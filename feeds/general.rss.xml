&lt;p&gt;So, basically the year over! I decided to write this little post because 2017 was a agitate and &amp;lsquo;weird&amp;rsquo; year for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id="10-month-of-resultados-digitias"&gt;10 month of Resultados Digitias&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I spend 10 months as a Software Engineer at Resultados Digitais (RD). And although I really don’t like the city I moved (Florianopolis) the RD was one of the best things that happen in my professional life this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 10 months can easily read as ‘2 years’ or something like this. I learned a lot with great people and made friends for a life. I would thank guys from Resultados Digitais for everything! especially to the friends and colleagues of Dispatch Team. You guys are great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am looking into opportunities to working remotely and for some European company, I decided to move forward and leave RD, what drives us to the next big thing of 2017: GuestReady!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="starting-work-for-guestready"&gt;Starting work for GuestReady&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the 10 months at Resultados Digitais I had the opportunity to join to GuestReady! I left Florianopolis city and currently I live in a small town that makes me happier and full of joy (not always, :d).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GuestReady had a team distributed across 3 continents (Europe, South America, and Asia). The engineering team is fully distributed between Brazil, Ukraine, Czech Republic and UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I could not have made a better choice! Working for GuestReady is so exciting! Be part of a team full remotely is a challenge, but also open opportunity for many good things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018 (February, I think) I will move to Europe (Budapest and Prague) for 3 months with a Brazilian friend (and soon GuestReady colleague) in order to meet some colleagues and enjoy the ride, and of course, continue help making GuestReady better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="see-you-guys-in-the-next-year"&gt;See you guys in the next year!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in short, that’s it a would like to share. I hope everybody has a great end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you!!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
